                spaces in mind, <br>
                filled with spice of love; <br>
                or poison of loneliness; <br>
                who knows? <br>
                all we know is what <br> 
                that facial mirror expresses! <br>
                it sometimes feels <br>
                awful to be incapable to step inside <br>
                those secret memoirs <br>
                present inside those head spaces,

                heartbroken and unhappy <br> 
                i still cry <br>
                wishing that someone <br> 
                could just utter that cancerous truth <br>
                haunting my sleeps and peace...
